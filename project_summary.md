## Description
Our project review the principles of visual poetry, sculpting text into imaginary cities. Based upon Italo Calvino's book “The Invisible Cities”, our installation aims to build a multimedia journey through text-analysis-generated 3D models of the cities described by Marco Polo to Kublai Kahn. Using the Natural Language Processing Tool Kit for Python, Rhino-Python, Processing and Kinect, our goal is to generate an immersive dream in which users can experience the two characters of the book as they navigate through the installation: traveling as Marco Polo, and listening as Kublai Khan.
